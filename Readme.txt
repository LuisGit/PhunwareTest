3rd Party frameworks used:

what kind of connectivity is it ( WIFI / GSM / 4G), and when it changes its state (Online / Offline).

iOS Target:
-This app works in iOS 8 and iOS 7 devices.
-This app works in iPhone and iPad devices.

Approach:
- Auto Layout was used in order to keep split UI from functional code, so most of the design is done in a single Storyboard for all devices.
- Auto Size Classes was used in order to keep split UI from functional code, so most of the label / Image size is done in a single Storyboard for all devices.
- Git local repository: I used it in order to provide an idea of the flow done through the development time. To see it, please go for Source Control / History in Xcode menu.
